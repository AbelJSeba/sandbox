# Demo-oriented override config to capture output artifacts from sandbox runs.
# Use with: ./fort -config examples/fort.sandbox-artifacts.yml -mode sandbox ...
#
# This keeps network disabled, but allows write operations in the sandbox so
# /app/output artifacts can be produced and later parsed by LLM analysis.
